/*
Write a function that computes the dominant writing direction in a string of text. Remember that each
script object has a direction property that can be "ltr" (left to right), "rtl" (right to left), or
"ttb" (top to bottom).

The dominant direction is the direction of a majority of the characters that have a script associated
with them. The characterScript and countBy functions defined earlier in the chapter are probably useful here.

function dominantDirection(text) {
  Your code here.
}

console.log(dominantDirection("Hello!"));
    → ltr
console.log(dominantDirection("Hey, مساء الخير"));
    → rtl
